Title: Visualization of the alignment of a mapped read
Description: This R package provides a function that extracts the primary alignment of a desired read and enables the visualization of its alignment along its reference sequence, as an useful useful quality control inspection tool. As to achieve this, the package also includes some internal functions for managing CIGAR operations, determining the reference sequence of the full read, as well as the recomputing the consumed read and reference sequences upon accounting for the CIGAR operations.
